**Basics and settings**

FrontEnd for MealsAndBeers app from this repo. Made using vaadin and some CSS editing. It has spring security up, so  
to get past login page you need to create account, everything other than login page and create account is secured.
Functionalities related to emails are not implemented, so while creating account you can write "whatever@mail" and it will pass.
Because of that there is also no way to reset your password.
